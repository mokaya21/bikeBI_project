# Elite Bike Shop KPI Dashboard

## Introduction
Efficient urban transportation is a crucial element of sustainable city development, and bike-sharing programs play a vital role in reducing congestion, promoting eco-friendly travel, and enhancing accessibility. This project focuses on creating an interactive KPI dashboard to analyze bike share data for Elite Bike Shop, providing valuable insights into user behaviour, operational performance, and key trends.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to empower decision-makers with data-driven insights to optimize bike-sharing services, improve user experience, and identify areas for growth and efficiency. By consolidating key metrics into a visually engaging and user-friendly interface, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor performance, track progress against targets, and make informed decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset captures transactional data from Elite bike-sharing program, providing detailed insights into rider behaviour and usage patterns. The key attributes include:

- dteday: The date of the transaction, indicating when the ride occurred.
- season: The various quarters of a calendar year.
- year: The year in which the transaction occurred.
- hour: The specific hour of the day when the ride took place.
- month: The month of the year.
- working day: A binary indicator of whether the ride occurred on a working day (1) or not (0).
- rider type: The rider category (e.g., casual, registered).
- riders: The count of riders for a given transaction.
- price: The price charged to hire a bike.
- COGS: The costs incurred for the acquisition and maintenance of the bikes.
 
We added new attributes for easier analysis and creating visuals to see patterns in the dataset:
  
- revenue: This attribute was created by multiplying the number of riders and price. 
- profit: This attribute was generated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the revenue earned.

This dataset spans two years, from 2021 to 2022.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Power BI for dashboard creation and visualizations.
- Microsoft SSMS for data manipulation.
  
## Key Performance Indicators(KPIs)
- Hourly Revenue Analysis: This metric helps us to see how much money the business makes in every working hour, enabling us to identify peak and off-peak hours of the business's operations.
- Profit and Revenue Trends: This information allows us to determine whether the business is performing well or not in terms of income earned over the 2 years.
- Seasonal Revenue: This metric enables us to see the amount of income the business generates in the different quarters of the year.
- Rider Demographics: This metric allows us to check the distribution of riders based on their category(registered and casual).

## Data Workflow
1. Data Collection
   
- The data was sourced from a github repository in three separate csv files.

2. Data manipulation

- Tools used: Power BI Power Query and Microsoft SSMS.
- Created a database using the files.
- Extracted the required columns from the files using Microsoft SSMS then exported the result set to Power BI.
- Derived metrics such as profit and revenue.
- Standardized the data.
  
3. Data modelling
 
- Designed a new measure using Data Analysis Expressions(DAX), Profit Margin, to calculate the profit margin based on generated income.

4. Data visualization

- Designed an intuitive layout in Power BI with charts, tables, and KPIs.
- Emphasized accessibility by using colour-coded visuals and clear legends.

## Insights
- Demand increased by 65% in 2022 despite a price increase of 25%
- More revenue was generated in 2022($10M), compared to 2021($5M)
- The most revenue is generated in Q3.
- Majority of the riders are registered members(81.17%).
- Peak operating hours are evenings for weekdays whereas during weekends, the business operates optimally between 10 a.m and 5 p.m.
  
## Recommendations
- Make a subtle price increase, somewhere between 5%-10%, but be flexible to adjust prices based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. This will enable the company to adopt an optimal price that increases overall profitability and maintains the same level of demand, if it does not increase it.
- Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction and the overall economic environment to get guidance on whether to follow through with the price increase or not.
- Consider adopting different pricing models for casual vs registered users since they may have different price sensitivities.
- The company could offer discounts during Q4 to drive more income generation during this period since Q4 notably had significantly less revenue earned compared to Q2 and Q3.
- Ensure customer service is fully working during peak hours to ensure customer satisfaction.

## Challenges 
- Inconsistent data types in columns like dteday.

## Solutions
- Standardized the data types using Power BI Power Query.

## Conclusion
The KPI Dashboard for Elite Bike Shop has successfully provided valuable insights into operational, demographic, and financial performance. It serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive the growth of the bike share program.
